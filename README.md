Problem statement
----

Electrical Components Company (ECC) is a large-scale manufacturing company that produces electrical components for major airlines and consumer goods companies.  Component orders produced by ECC often undergo several processes in different areas of the facility, and are passed between many supervisors and machine operators along the way, leaving room for orders to be misplaced and lost.  ECC operates under a tight schedule, and locating each order along each stage of the production process is critical to ensuring that components are produced and shipped on time.
	
ECC currently uses a paper contract system, which includes the use of a paper contract that accompanies each order as it moves through the factory, and details how long each process should take and where the order must be sent after the process is completed.  While the method is simple, it restricts management’s ability to locate orders of concern and to ensure that each order is completed in a timely manner.  Time requirements listed on the paper contract are often incorrect, and usually based entirely on estimates by engineers rather than on actual process time.  Incorrect estimates often lead to late shipments that could otherwise be avoided.
	
ECC’s efficiency and production could be improved by instituting a system that allows management to track each order’s progress, both physically and where it is in its respective production process, while also allowing management to easily adjust expected process time for each step in a component’s production.  An electronic system would also allow the elimination of the paper contracts which are often damaged and difficult to read by the end of a component’s production, reducing an operator’s ability to understand the expectations of each process and increasing the probability that the components will be produced incorrectly.

Defining the scope of the project
----

The system will have to be made accessible to both machine operators and various management and analysis personnel across multiple computers.  The system will allow management to enter new contracts into the system as requested by customers, and will direct each order to the appropriate area of the facility to begin production.  Machine operators will be able to view the contracts available to their work area in order of due date.  Once an operator has completed their part of the production process, they will be able to clear the components to continue to the next process with the use of their employee number, and will also be able to update process time requirements as necessary.  Employees will also be able to specify if a given contract is on its way to the next area, or if it has arrived and is waiting.  The system will then update the contract to reflect the updated time requirements, as well as the current location of the components.

The system will be run by the in-house IT department employed at ECC, and will be made available throughout the facility using a company server.

* The system will be run by the in-house IT department employed at ECC, and will be made available throughout the facility using a company server.

* Allow management and analysis personnel to track the progress of each contract to address concerns relating to productivity and the flow of work through the facility

* Store updated time requirements so similar contracts in the future will have more accurate predictions associated with their expected completion date

Initial Project Plan Stages
----

* **Project Identification**: The business will be fully examined so problems can be identified.  The analyst will determine what the goals of the business are and then decide if an information system can help them reach their objectives.

* **Determining Information Requirements**: The analyst will study the current system, identifying the information requirements in order to understand how the new system can support the users and the business. Interviews are conducted at this phase and questionnaires are developed, distributed and the results analyzed. Data models and an event response list will be created.

* **Analyzing System Needs**: The input, processes, and outputs of the system will be examined and charted using Data Flow Diagrams. The data needs will be determined and a Data Dictionary defining all of the required data elements will be produced. Structured Decisions will be identified and a Systems Proposal will be presented.

* **Designing the Recommended System**: If approved the logical design of the information system will be developed. Program and File specifications, Input and Output layouts, processing details and flowcharts will be created.

* **Developing and Documenting the Software**: In this stage the programs will be coded using the outputs from stage 4 above. All manuals and documentation will be written.

* **Testing and Maintaining the System**: The system’s programs must be individually tested with both valid and invalid data.  Then, the system as a whole must be tested again with both valid and invalid data.  Any problems that are encountered will be corrected and the documentation will be updated to reflect changes.

* **Implementing and Evaluating the System**: The new system will be installed on-site and the users will be trained.  The system will be evaluated for correctness and ease of use.
